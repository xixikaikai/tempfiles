## codes of the test
this is for js script of a range list

I just learned the ECMA 6 book and studied the codes of range list,
for the codes, I just combined the two js file in one, and run in my chrome.

For me, I think the codes is a good sample, and I am not able to write better
codes than this one, so I just post it, and I'm considering of coding would be better after a time of imitating.
